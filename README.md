# CVE-2023-34840
## Vulnerability Explanation
All versions in [angular-ui-notification](https://github.com/alexcrack/angular-ui-notification) are vulnerable to XSS due to the library not sanitizing the input provided by the user.

In order to safely use this library, sanitizing / encoding the parameters passed to this library is **highly** recommended, such as the following:

```ts
private sanitizeHTML(str: string) {
    return str.replace(/[^\w. ]/gi, (c) => `&#${c.charCodeAt(0)};`);
  }
```

## Exploitation
Say the library has already been imported and is currently being used by a project. The usage of this library could look like the following:

```ts
private showNotification(content: string, delay: number, type: NotificationType) {
  this.Notification.clearAll();
  
  this.Notification[type]({
    message: content,
    delay,
    replaceMessage: true
  });
}
```

If frontend was to pass any user input directly to the `content` parameter, any `<script>` tag would be enough to perform an XSS attack.

A simple `<script>alert(1)</script>` would be enough.
